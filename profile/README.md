# Project Reclude

## About this Project

Project Reclude revolves around the concept of self-sustained applications.
These applications, categorized into `productivity` and `utility`, have been 
thoughtfully developed by [Aditya Jyoti](https://github.com/Aditya-Jyoti) to cater 
to his personal requirements while remaining accessible to a broader user base.
Their inherent minimalistic design ensures ease of comprehension and user-friendliness for all.
