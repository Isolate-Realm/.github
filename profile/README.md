# Project Isolate Realm

## About this Project
Project Isolate Realm revolves around the concept of self-sustained applications. 
These applications, categorized into `productivity` and `utility`, have been thoughtfully developed by [Aditya Jyoti](https://github.com/Aditya-Jyoti) to cater to his personal requirements while remaining accessible to a broader user base.
Their inherent minimalistic design ensures ease of comprehension and user-friendliness for all.
