# Project Isolate Realm

## About this Project

Project Isolate Realm revolves around the concept of self-sustained applications.
These applications, categorized into `productivity` and `utility`, have been 
thoughtfully developed by [Aditya Jyoti](https://github.com/Aditya-Jyoti) to cater

## Why a Snow Leopard?

Isolate Realm embodies self-reliance and adaptability. Snow leopards don't rely on packs to succeed as
hunters; they are solitary and self-sufficient. Similarly, this project aims to provide the author and 
the users with self-reliant tools and applications that are highly adaptable to a wide range of needs 
and circumstances.
